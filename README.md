At this point you have two choices:

  1. Email & Password
  2. Enter your authentication token

If you decide to use the token, open this link: [https://www.speleodb.org/private/auth-token/](https://www.speleodb.org/private/auth-token/)

> [!CAUTION]  
> Treat this `token` as your password ! It will give complete access to your account if you share this "token".<br>
> **In case you need to change it => click on `Refresh Token` (the red button).**

Let's copy/paste the token in the app and click `CONNECT`

# 3. Opening a project

Once connected you should see appearing the list of project you have access to

![Screenshot 2025-06-21 at 12 15 31](assets/tutorial8.png)

Click any of the projects. This will download and load the project you want.

In the background, Ariane acquires the project lock for you (if you have write access and nobody is currently modifying the file).

From that point you can:

- Modify the project and upload a new revision by clicking `Save Project`

- Change project by going back to the `Projects` tab

- Unlock the project and quit Ariane

Hope you have fun ! Feel free to give me any feedback
