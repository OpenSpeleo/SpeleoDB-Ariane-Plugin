# SpeleoDB Plugin Monorepo

This repository contains the SpeleoDB plugin ecosystem for cave surveying applications.

## Recent Updates

### ✅ Auto-Lock Acquisition on Project Creation (COMPLETED)

**Feature**: When creating a new project through the SpeleoDB plugin, the system now automatically:

1. **Creates the project** via the SpeleoDB API
2. **Immediately acquires the lock** on the newly created project  
3. **Creates an empty TML file** as a starting point for survey data
4. **Loads the project** into the application for immediate editing
5. **Enables all editing actions** (upload, unlock buttons) since the lock is acquired
6. **Refreshes the project list** to show the new project with lock status

**Benefits**:
- **Seamless workflow**: Users can immediately start working on new projects
- **No manual lock acquisition**: Eliminates the extra step of manually acquiring locks
- **Ready-to-edit state**: New projects open directly in edit mode with all tools available
- **Immediate feedback**: UI instantly reflects the locked/editable state

**Technical Implementation**:
- Enhanced `onCreateNewProject()` method in `SpeleoDBController`
- Added `createEmptyTmlFile()` utility method for generating starter TML files
- Integrated with existing lock management and UI state systems
- Comprehensive error handling for lock acquisition failures
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing project workflows

**Error Handling**:
- If lock acquisition fails, the project is still created successfully
- Users receive clear feedback about lock status
- Fallback behavior ensures no data loss or workflow interruption

This feature completes the "Project Creation" requirements from the Feature List and significantly improves the user experience for new project workflows.

### ✅ Centralized Lock Management System (COMPLETED)

**Problem Solved**: Lock acquisition logic was duplicated across multiple locations in the codebase:
- Project creation (auto-lock feature)
- Project opening (with UI updates)  
- Test methods (with retry logic)
- Manual lock operations

**Solution Implemented**: Created a comprehensive centralized lock management system with three specialized methods:

#### **🔧 Core Components**

**1. `LockResult` Class**
- Immutable result object with detailed lock operation information
- Contains: success status, descriptive message, project reference, error details
- Factory methods: `success()`, `failure()`, `error()`

**2. `acquireProjectLock()` - Core Logic**
- Centralized lock acquisition with comprehensive error handling
- Automatic read-only permission checking
- Consistent logging with emoji indicators (🔄 🔒 ✓ ⚠️ ❌)
- Context-aware messaging for different operation types

**3. `acquireProjectLockWithUI()` - UI Integration**
- Handles lock acquisition with automatic UI state management
- Success/failure callbacks for custom behavior
- Automatic project assignment and UI control enabling/disabling
- Runs on background thread with UI updates on JavaFX thread

#### **🎯 Benefits Achieved**

**Code Reduction**:
- ✅ Eliminated ~80 lines of duplicated lock logic
- ✅ Reduced from 4 different patterns to 1 centralized system
- ✅ Consistent error handling and logging across all lock operations

**Improved Maintainability**:
- ✅ Single source of truth for lock acquisition behavior
- ✅ Easier to modify lock logic (change once, affects all usages)
- ✅ Standardized error messages and logging format

**Enhanced Reliability**:
- ✅ Consistent permission checking (read-only projects)
- ✅ Proper exception handling with detailed error reporting
- ✅ Thread-safe UI updates with Platform.runLater()

**Better User Experience**:
- ✅ Consistent feedback messages across all lock operations
- ✅ Clear visual indicators (emoji) for different operation states
- ✅ Context-aware messages ("project creation", "project opening", etc.)

#### **📍 Usage Examples**

```java
// With UI integration
acquireProjectLockWithUI(project, "project creation",
    () -> showSuccessAnimation("Ready to edit!"),
    () -> showWarning("Read-only mode")
);

// Full control with detailed result
LockResult result = acquireProjectLock(project, "manual operation");
if (result.hasError()) {
    handleLockError(result.getError());
}
```

#### **🔄 Refactored Components**
- **Project Creation**: Now uses `acquireProjectLockWithUI()` with success/failure callbacks
- **Project Opening**: Streamlined with step-by-step logic using `acquireProjectLock()`

This refactoring provides a solid foundation for the upcoming heartbeat system implementation and eliminates the "reinventing the wheel" problem you identified.

This is a gradle dev environment for the **SpeleoDB Ariane Plugin**

The **com.arianesline.plugincontainer** application will load the plugin located in its *plugin* folder in a dummy environment and ease the debugging process

### ✅ UI Freeze Fix - Project Creation Performance (COMPLETED)

**Problem Identified**: The application was freezing for 2-3 seconds after project creation during the lock acquisition phase.

**Root Cause**: Heavy operations (TML file creation, survey loading, SpeleoDB ID updates) were being executed on the JavaFX UI thread via `Platform.runLater()`, blocking the user interface.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- **Moved heavy operations back to background thread** - File I/O and survey operations now run asynchronously
- **Separated UI updates from heavy operations** - Only lightweight UI state changes run on JavaFX thread
- **Maintained proper threading model** - Background work → UI updates pattern

#### **🔧 Technical Changes**

**Before** (Causing UI Freeze):
```java
Platform.runLater(() -> {
    // ❌ Heavy operations on UI thread
    createEmptyTmlFile(projectId, projectName);     // File I/O
    parentPlugin.loadSurvey(emptyTmlFile.toFile()); // Survey loading
    checkAndUpdateSpeleoDBId(createdProject);       // API calls
    showSuccessAnimation("Project created!");       // UI update
});
```

**After** (Smooth Performance):
```java
parentPlugin.executorService.execute(() -> {
    // ✅ Heavy operations on background thread
    createEmptyTmlFile(projectId, projectName);     // File I/O
    parentPlugin.loadSurvey(emptyTmlFile.toFile()); // Survey loading
    checkAndUpdateSpeleoDBId(createdProject);       // API calls
    
    Platform.runLater(() -> {
        // ✅ Only lightweight UI updates on JavaFX thread
        showSuccessAnimation("Project created!");
        updateUIControls();
    });
});
```

#### **🚀 Performance Impact**

**Before Fix**:
- ❌ **2-3 second UI freeze** during project creation
- ❌ Unresponsive interface during lock acquisition
- ❌ Poor user experience with no feedback

**After Fix**:
- ✅ **Immediate UI responsiveness** - no freezing
- ✅ Background operations don't block interface
- ✅ Smooth user experience with proper feedback

#### **🎯 Threading Best Practices Applied**

1. **Heavy Operations** → Background thread (`executorService`)
2. **UI Updates** → JavaFX thread (`Platform.runLater()`)
3. **Proper Error Handling** → Exceptions caught and UI updated appropriately
4. **User Feedback** → Progress indicators and status messages remain responsive

This fix ensures the application remains responsive during all project creation operations while maintaining the same functionality and user experience quality.

### ✅ Template-Based TML File Creation (COMPLETED)

**Improvement**: Updated new project creation to use a proper TML template file instead of generating XML content programmatically.

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Proper TML structure** - Uses real TML file format (ZIP archive) instead of XML text
- ✅ **Consistent with downloads** - Same binary file handling as downloaded projects
- ✅ **Maintainable template** - Template can be updated independently of code
- ✅ **Reliable format** - Eliminates XML generation errors and encoding issues

#### **🔧 Technical Implementation**

**Before** (XML Generation):
```java
// ❌ Generated XML text (not proper TML format)
String emptyTmlContent = String.format("""
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <tml version="1.0">
        <project name="%s">
            <description>New project created in SpeleoDB</description>
            <speleodb_id>%s</speleodb_id>
        </project>
    </tml>
    """, projectName, projectId);
Files.write(tmlFilePath, emptyTmlContent.getBytes());
```

**After** (Template Copy):
```java
// ✅ Copy proper TML template file (ZIP format)
try (var templateStream = getClass().getResourceAsStream("/tml/empty_project.tml")) {
    Files.copy(templateStream, tmlFilePath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
}
```

#### **📁 Template File Location**
- **Path**: `org.speleodb.ariane.plugin.speleodb/src/main/resources/tml/empty_project.tml`
- **Format**: Binary TML file (ZIP archive) - same as downloaded projects
- **Usage**: Automatically copied for each new project creation

This ensures new projects start with a proper, well-formed TML file structure that's identical to what users would get from downloading an existing project.
